SSL + socks5 VPN using [stunnel](https://www.stunnel.org/) for Android.

Allows you to easily set up stunnel clientside with android, and tunnel your phone's internet connection through it. This system should bypass most blocks if you have an unblocked domain, as it looks exactly like normal HTTPS traffic.
